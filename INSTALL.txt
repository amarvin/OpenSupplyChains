Sourcemap Database Installation from Scratch        #database
--------------------------------------------

1.  Be sure you have PostgreSQL properly installed.  I use 8.4.

    On Ubuntu, or other Linux distributions which use apt, you can do the following:

        apt-get install postgresql

2.  a. Install PostGIS.  Most packaged installations will also make available
       a database template you can use to create a database with GIS features.
    b. Alternatively, you can install PostGIS 1.4 which is compatible with 
       PostgreSQL 8.4. Install all the neccessary files from synaptic then run the below commands.  
       ./configure
       make
       make install

3.  Create a database user.  You'll need to be logged in as a root database
    user or as postgresql in order to have sufficient priveleges to complete
    this step.

4.  Create a new database.  On Linux, you can do this as follows:

        createdb -T postgistemplate -O userfrom3above databasename

5.  Create the necessary procedural language on the new database.

        createlang plpgsql databasename

5.  Sign into the database you made as the user you created.

        psql --host localhost --user userfrom3above -p databasename

6.  Load the PostGIS functions:

        \i /usr/share/doc/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis.sql
        \i /usr/share/doc/postgresql/8.4/contrib/spatial_ref_sys.sql
        \i /usr/share/doc/postgresql/8.4/contrib/postgis_comment.sql

7.  Load the Sourcemap core schema:

        \i /home/me/path/to/my/repository/db/schema/00_initial.sql

8.  Load additional files, all numbered sequentially.

9.  Be sure you run the commands as the user you hope to use.  If
    you need to change  ownership of a table, you can do this with
    the 'alter table' command:
    
        alter table tablename owner to 'newowner';

10. Configure your Kohana/Sourcemap configuration to use this database.

Database Configuration for Kohana/Sourcemap Core and Sites  #dbconfig
----------------------------------------------------------
1.  If you're editing the core Sourcemap database configuration, do so
    in the www/application/config/database.php file.  You'll need to be sure
    you use the value PDOPGSQL as the database type.  This is a custom class
    which extends Kohana's PDO library in order to support the lean Kohana
    ORM.

2.  If you're editing a site-specific configuration, this is done the same way
    as in number one above, but the database.php file goes in 
    www/sites/mysite/config/.

3.  The repository is (sometimes) missing default database.php files in these
    directories.  A sample can be found in modules/database/.

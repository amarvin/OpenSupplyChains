    <p>
        The problem of sustainability is critical: how are we going to provide for future generations? While many people recognize that business-as-usual is unsustainable, most of us go through life with little feedback on the social or environmental impact of our actions. Sourcemap.com is a suite of tools to support sustainable decision-making: a catalog of product origins and carbon footprints, a life-cycle assessment calculator, and a social network for sharing sustainable practices. As you browse this site, you'll find information contributed by companies, non-profit organizations, experts, and everyday people who want to expand our shared understanding of sustainability.

One day, we hope to offer information on the source and the impact of all products and services so that everyone can make sustainable choices. Here's how we.re working to achieve that goal:

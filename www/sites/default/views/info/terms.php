Users of the Sourcemap.com website (the “Site”) are encouraged to contribute their own items and products as well as build off of the information contributed by others. Sourcemap itself maintains an ever-growing library of the carbon costs associated with various raw materials, processes, and modes of transport.</p>

<h2>Terms & Conditions</h2>

These Terms of Service constitute an agreement that describes the legal relationship between a user (an individual, representing him or herself, or if applicable, acting as legal representative for a group, institution, company or corporation) and Sourcemap Inc. of 614 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA (USA) (the “Agreement”).

Each Member is entirely responsible for all activities that occur on or through his or her Sourcemap account(s).</p>

<p><h4>(4) User Contributions</h4>
Sourcemap Site users may contribute to the Site in a variety of ways.
Members may create new sourcemaps for any products or processes. In creating these sourcemaps, Members may contribute their own carbon values for objects and processes or draw upon those values that have been researched and listed by Sourcemap for this purpose. If a Member contributes values to Sourcemap, Sourcemap may contact that Member and request citations for the resources upon which the Member relied in contributing those values. By contributing values to the Site, a Member agrees to provide those references to Sourcemap upon request. Every Member further agrees to maintain the accuracy of information he or she provides, updating the Site as necessary on a prompt and timely basis.

<br/><br/>Members who create sourcemaps may choose to make those sourcemaps publicly available or private. If a sourcemap is designated private, no one other than the Member who created the sourcemap and Sourcemap staff (including but not limited to Site administrators) will be able to access it.

<br/><br/>Members may also add text descriptions and links to external web sites or embed media hosted by other web sites. Members may comment on any sourcemap, designate any sourcemap as a “favorite,” or otherwise annotate sourcemaps. All comments, “favorite” designations, and additional annotations are publicly available.

Any information that users contribute may be relied upon by other users. Sourcemap is not obligated to remove any user account or the information associated with or posted by that account upon request. Even if Sourcemap decides to remove information from visibility on the Site, Sourcemap reserves the right to retain that information for restoration, archival, or research purposes.<br/><br/>

<h2>Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Policy</h2>
<p><h4>(1)    Introduction</h4>
Sourcemap responds expeditiously to clear notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). This page describes the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to Sourcemap as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the form suggested by the DMCA (the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov), but Sourcemap will respond to notices of this type from other jurisdictions as well.

<br/><br/>Sourcemap expects all its users to comply with applicable copyright laws. However, if Sourcemap receives proper notification of claimed copyright infringement, Sourcemap's response to these notices will include removing or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing activity and/or terminating subscribers, regardless of whether Sourcemap may be liable for such infringement under United States law or the laws of another jurisdiction.

<br/><br/>If Sourcemap removes or disables access in response to such a notice, Sourcemap will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner, administrator, or poster of the affected site or content so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Sourcemap may also document the notices of alleged infringement on which it acts. </p>

<p><h4>(2)    Designated Agent</h4>
Sourcemap's Designated Agent to receive notification of alleged infringement under the DMCA is:
Leonardo Bonanni<br/>
Email: dmca@sourcemap.com<br/>
Mail: 167 Erie St, Cambridge MA 02139

<br/><br/>Upon receipt of proper notification of claimed infringement, Sourcemap will follow the procedures outlined herein and in the DMCA.</p>

<p><h4>(3)    Infringement Notification</h4>
If you believe that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, please provide Sourcemap's Registered Agent (listed above) with the following information in a written communication (preferably via email): 
<br/><br/>1.    Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; 

<br/><br/>2.    Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Sourcemap to locate the material; 

<br/><br/>3.    Information reasonably sufficient to permit Sourcemap to contact the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an email address at which the complaining party may be contacted; 
<br/><br/>4.    The following statement: I have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; 
<br/><br/>5.    The following statement: I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is accurate, and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; and 
<br/><br/>6.    A physical or electronic signature of the owner or a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. 
<br/><br/>Please note that you may be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material available online infringes your copyright, you should first contact an attorney.
</p><p><h4>(4)    Counter Notification</h4>
A provider of content subject to a claim of infringement may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. To file a counter notification with us, please provide Sourcemap's Registered Agent (listed above) with the following information in a written communication (preferably via email): 
<br/><br/>1.    Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; 
<br/><br/>2.    Your name, address, and telephone number; 
<br/><br/>3.    The following statement: I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the [insert the federal judicial district in which your address is located]; 
<br/><br/>4.    The following statement: I will accept service of process from [insert the name of the person who submitted the infringement notification] or his/her agent; 
<br/><br/>5.    The following statement: I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good faith belief that the affected material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and 
<br/><br/>6.    Your signature, in physical or electronic form. 
Upon receipt of such counter notification, Sourcemap will promptly provide the person who provided the original infringement notification with a copy of the counter notification, and inform that person that Sourcemap will replace the removed material or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days. Sourcemap will replace the removed material and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the counter notice, unless Sourcemap's Designated Agent first receives notice from the person who submitted the original infringement notification that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the subscriber from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on our system or network.
</p><p><h4>(5)    Repeat Infringers</h4>
In accordance with Section 512(i)(1)(a) of the DMCA, Sourcemap will, in appropriate circumstances, disable and/or terminate the accounts of users who are repeat infringers. 
</p><p><h4>(6)    Accommodation of Standard Technical Measures</h4>
It is Sourcemap's policy to accommodate and not interfere with standard technical measures used by copyright owners to identify or protect copyrighted works that Sourcemap determines are reasonable under the circumstances. </p>

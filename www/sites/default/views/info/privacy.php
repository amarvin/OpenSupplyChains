    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <h3>Sourcemap Privacy Policy ver1.0</h3> 
    <p><h4>Introduction</h4>
    Sourcemap respects the privacy of its users. This policy sets out the limited manner in which Sourcemap will collect and use its users’ information to provide and improve its services.  </p> 
    <p><h4>(1)  Information Sourcemap Collects</h4>
    The Sourcemap website (the “Site”), like many other websites, collects certain information about visitors, even those who are not registered users and users who are not logged in. When a user browses or downloads information from the Site, data is collected including but not limited to the user’s IP address, URL request, browser type, and the date and time of the user’s request.  </p> 
    <p>Sourcemap also collects and stores any information a registered user (“Member”) provides to the Site, including but not limited to the Member’s username, email address, and profile data.   </p> 
    <p><h4>(2) Use of Information</h4>
    The data Sourcemap collects is analyzed in various ways, largely through an analysis service called Google Analytics, whose privacy policy can be found here.
    Sourcemap may use the email address a Member provides to contact that Member.  For more information, please refer to the “Contacting Users” section in Sourcemap’s Terms of Service. </p> 
    <p><h4>(3)  Disclosure of Information</h4>
    Log records, account information, and all material contributed to the Site may be accessed by Sourcemap staff. In addition to the uses described above, this information may be disclosed if Sourcemap is compelled to do so by law or if disclosure is necessary to establish, exercise, or defend Sourcemap’s legal rights.  </p> 
    <p><h4>(4)  Cookies</h4>
    Cookies are small text files that the Site can send to a user’s browser for storage on the hard drive of that user’s computer. Cookies make use of the Site easier by saving a user’s status and preferences. Cookies are refreshed every time a user visits. The Site may use session cookies to track a user’s interactions with Sourcemap’s services during an individual visit. To facilitate Sourcemap’s registration and login functions, Sourcemap may also use cookies to recognize when a Member returns to the Site. If a user does not logout of his or her account, these cookies allow Sourcemap to keep track of that user’s username and password so that the user does not have to resubmit the information to log into his or her account. If a user shares a computer with multiple people, that user should logout of his or her account so that the user’s logon information is cleared. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but a user may be able to change a browser’s settings to refuse cookies or to be alerted when cookies are being sent. </p> 
    <p><h4>(5) Removal of Information</h4>
    Sourcemap is not obligated to remove any user account, content posted by any account, or information associated by any account upon request. Even if Sourcemap decides to remove information from visibility on the Site, Sourcemap reserves the right to keep an archive of that information for restoration, archival, or research purposes. </p> 
    <p><h4>(6)  Underage Users</h4>
    Sourcemap will not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If a parent or legal guardian of a child under age 13 believes that child has submitted personal information to the Site, please contact Sourcemap immediately.  </p> 
    <p><h4>(7) Other Websites</h4>
    The Site may link to other websites. Sourcemap is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such websites.  </p> 
    <p><h4>(8) Changes</h4>
    Sourcemap may occasionally change this privacy policy. Please check back regularly to review the current version. A user’s continued use of the Site following such changes will constitute a user’s assent to them.</p>

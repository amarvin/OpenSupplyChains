Topics could include:\n\n-What is available in my foodshed?\n-What's in season?\n-Where can I get locally-sourced foods?\n-Where do the foods I eat come from? How do they get to me?\n-How can I help my local farmers?\n-How do I grow my own food?\n-How do I preserve my own food?\n\nThe organic food movement is a fine step, but we need to move beyond it. The food we buy in the supermarket (including much of the organic stuff) travels an average of 1500 miles, and is therefore heavily dependent on our unsustainable, petroleum-based transportation system. If we continue to use petroleum the way we do now, we will run out in our children's lifetime.\n","slug":"Calvert-Eats-Local-1","category":"","weight":"0","emissions":"0","embodied":"0","transport":"0","process":null,"endoflife":null,"shipping":"0","lifetime":null,"usagetype":"","usageenergy":null,"usageemissions":null,"timecreated":"2011-05-24 07:38:20","timemodified":"2011-05-24 07:38:20","visibility":"public","showfootprint":"on","showembodied":"on","showtransport":"on","showprocess":"on","showendoflife":"on","showlastleg":"on","showuse":"on","showstats":"on","stops":{"origin":{"related_to":"1167","part_or_object":"o","notes":null,"placename":"Prince Frederick, MD, USA","id":"15995","category":"1","lat":"38.5403996","lon":"-76.5844017","name":"origin","hops":{"incoming":[],"outgoing":[]}}},"user":{"name":"hbudd","id":"13297"}}}

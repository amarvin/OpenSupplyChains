We're particularly proud of this Ugandan supply chain - the cotton jersey knit is 100% Ugandan, from seed to textile. We opened a second workshop for our apparel production, located in Kampala. The electrical supply in Gulu was too unpredictable to produce apparel (since garments require electric machine operations). This new workshop enabled us to provide 20 new jobs to individuals in Kampala who lost their jobs when garment factories went out of business. We pay our staff more than double the rate they were paid in the factory, creating sustainable employment without a high price tag for the end consumer.\nTo shop for our Party Dress, check out www.onemangotree.com","sm:migrated:time":1316559670},"other_perms":1,"stops":[{"geometry":"POINT(3626912.697131 34911.202281)","attributes":{"name":"OMT Party Dress","1":"Kampala, Uganda","address":"Kampala, Uganda","category":"1","title":"OMT Party Dress","qty":"0","co2e":0,"weight":"0","unit":"kg","description":"http:\/\/www.onemangotree.com\/partydress3.html\nOur organic cotton jersey collection is GOTS-certified.

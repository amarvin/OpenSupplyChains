Hilary is a former One Mango Tree Design Intern. The bag with twisted handles is one of our most popular designs. This map takes you on a geographical journey to understand where the pieces of the product come together. All components are gathered in Kampala and then transported (usually via public bus) to Gulu, where the handbags are cut and assembled by our 30 tailors in the One Mango Tree Gulu workshop. Once the product is complete, it's sent (again, via bus) back to Kampala and then shipped using FedEx courier services to our US office in Strongsville, Ohio. The hobo bag is part Chinese (textile), part Ugandan (textile), part American (label) and a whole lotta love.

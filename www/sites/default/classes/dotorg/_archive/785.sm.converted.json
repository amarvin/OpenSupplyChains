The idea is to compare the energies necessary to deliver two sorts of aid. The first is titled \"It's Just Aid.\" This encompasses a small foray by an international aid agency to drop off its aid to a destination while relying on the pre-existing local institutions to distribute the resources.  The second is titled \"Aid and Then Some.\" This adds 3 rather significant components necessary to ensure that donations are getting to the people that need them. These will include 1) A volunteer's travel, food, and housing to accompany the aid to its drop-point 2) The additional freight travel necessary to tote the aid around door-to-door 3) Additional packaging for individual distribution. Hopefully we can approximate and quantitatively assess the energy necessary for more effective aid in order to compare it to alternative technologies.

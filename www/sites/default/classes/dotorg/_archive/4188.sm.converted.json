Controversial human rights issues in China include policies such as capital punishment, the one-child policy, the social status of Tibetans, and lack of protections regarding freedom of press and religion. One of the foremost areas of concern is a lack of legal rights, for want of an independent judiciary, rule of law, and due process. Another prominent area of concern is lack of labor rights, which is related to the hukou system, the absence of independent unions, and discrimination against rural workers and ethnic minorities. Yet another area of concern is the lack of religious freedom, highlighted by state clashes with Christian, Tibetan Buddhist, and Falun Gong groups. Some indigenous groups are trying to expand these freedoms; they are Human Rights in China, Chinese Human Rights Defenders (CHRD) and China Human Rights Lawyers Concern Group (CHRLCG).\n\nhttp:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Human_rights_in_the_Peoples_Republic_of_China\n\n(Lead is a know carcinogenic.)\n"},"local_stop_id":4279}],"hops":[{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-11838468.395229 7584411.732747, 13465262.935892 2716627.939237))","from_stop_id":"4275","to_stop_id":"1971","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((2553391.487988 -3575670.675527, 13465262.935892 2716627.939237))","from_stop_id":"4276","to_stop_id":"1971","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8576650.343372 -1336955.902545, 13465262.935892 2716627.939237))","from_stop_id":"4277","to_stop_id":"1971","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((12696858.220752 2576898.857612, 13465262.935892 2716627.939237))","from_stop_id":"4278","to_stop_id":"1971","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((13056073.081842 3745027.530126, 13465262.935892 2716627.939237))","from_stop_id":"4279","to_stop_id":"1971","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}}]}}

The idea is to compare the energies necessary to deliver two sorts of aid. The first is titled \"It's Just Aid.\" This encompasses a small foray by an international aid agency to drop off its aid to a destination while relying on the pre-existing local institutions to distribute the resources.  The second is titled \"Aid and Then Some.\" This adds 3 rather significant components necessary to ensure that donations are getting to the people that need them. These will include 1) A volunteer's travel, food, and housing to accompany the aid to its drop-point 2) The additional freight travel necessary to tote the aid around door-to-door 3) Additional packaging for individual distribution. Hopefully we can approximate and quantitatively assess the energy necessary for more effective aid in order to compare it to alternative technologies. In addition, this will show just how much more effort it costs to go from B-grade donations to A-grade. \n\nIt's Just Aid:90 food units, large wooden crate, newspaper as packing material, travel\nAND THEN SOME: 90 food units, large wooden crate, 30 cardboard boxes + HUMAN ADDITION","slug":"its-just-aid","category":"","weight":"34.1","emissions":"434.952","embodied":"346.68","transport":"88.2718","process":"0","endoflife":"0","shipping":"11505","lifetime":"0","usagetype":"","usageenergy":"0","usageemissions":"0","timecreated":"2010-02-24 22:03:35.59828","timemodified":"2009-10-07 17:34:04","visibility":"private","showfootprint":"on","showembodied":"on","showtransport":"on","showprocess":"on","showendoflife":"on","showlastleg":"on","showuse":"on","showstats":"on","stops":{"origin":{"related_to":"785","part_or_object":"o","notes":"","placename":"Peru","id":"142","category":"1","lat":"-9.189967","lon":"-75.015152","name":"origin","hops":{"incoming":[{"transport_id":"16","id":"878","transport_name":"air, freight, intercontinental","transport_description":"intercontinental freight","transport_unit":"kg km","transport_co2_eq":"0.450000","from_stop_id":"3129","from_stop_lat":"42.3584308","from_stop_lon":"-71.0597732","to_stop_id":"142","to_stop_name":"origin","to_stop_lat":"-9.189967","placename":"Boston, MA, USA","to_stop_lon":"-75.015152","to_stop":{"id":"142","name":"origin","lat":"-9.189967","placename":"Peru","lon":"-75.015152"},"from_stop":{"name":"origin","id":"3129","lat":"42.3584308","lon":"-71.0597732","placename":"Boston, MA, USA"}},{"transport_id":"16","id":"881","transport_name":"air, freight, intercontinental","transport_description":"intercontinental freight","transport_unit":"kg km","transport_co2_eq":"0.450000","from_stop_id":"3132","from_stop_lat":"42.3584308","from_stop_lon":"-71.0597732","to_stop_id":"142","to_stop_name":"origin","to_stop_lat":"-9.189967","placename":"Boston, MA, USA","to_stop_lon":"-75.015152","to_stop":{"id":"142","name":"origin","lat":"-9.189967","placename":"Peru","lon":"-75.015152"},"from_stop":{"name":"origin","id":"3132","lat":"42.3584308","lon":"-71.0597732","placename":"Boston, MA, USA"}}],"outgoing":[]}}},"parts":[{"oid":"785","imid":"1062","linkid":"","weight":"15.9","rawemissions":"1.2","emissions":"19.08","shipping":"5752.48","processemissions":null,"endoflifeemissions":null,"disposaltype":null,"disposalenergy":null,"disposalimpact":null,"disposalemissions":null,"description":"12\" stack weighs 35 pounds (15.9 kg).

For this purpose fair produced resources are needed. FairPhone specifically asks attention for the social circumstances at the beginning of the production chain: the working and living conditions of the miners in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). \n\nWe aim to give insight in the utterly complex and non-transparent production chain of mobile phones. That is why we want to start with the development of our own mobile phone, exposing every link in the production chain and the coherent global problems. This makes FairPhone both the means and the target.","slug":"FairPhone---world-s-first-fair-mobile-phone","category":"","weight":"0","emissions":"0","embodied":"0","transport":"0","process":null,"endoflife":null,"shipping":"13413.44","lifetime":null,"usagetype":"","usageenergy":null,"usageemissions":null,"timecreated":"2011-04-16 02:46:40","timemodified":"2011-08-15 06:13:00","visibility":"public","showfootprint":"on","showembodied":"on","showtransport":"on","showprocess":"on","showendoflife":"on","showlastleg":"on","showuse":"on","showstats":"on","stops":{"origin":{"related_to":"1042","part_or_object":"o","notes":null,"placename":"The Netherlands","id":"17710","category":"1","lat":"52.132633","lon":"5.291266","name":"origin","hops":{"incoming":[{"transport_id":null,"id":"12691","transport_name":null,"transport_description":null,"transport_unit":null,"transport_co2_eq":null,"from_stop_id":"17711","from_stop_lat":"-10.7166667","from_stop_lon":"25.4666667","to_stop_id":"17710","to_stop_name":"origin","to_stop_lat":"52.132633","placename":"Kolwezi, Democratic Republic of the Congo","to_stop_lon":"5.291266","to_stop":{"id":"17710","name":"origin","lat":"52.132633","placename":"The Netherlands","lon":"5.291266"},"from_stop":{"name":"origin","id":"17711","lat":"-10.7166667","lon":"25.4666667","placename":"Kolwezi, Democratic Republic of the Congo"}},{"transport_id":null,"id":"12692","transport_name":null,"transport_description":null,"transport_unit":null,"transport_co2_eq":null,"from_stop_id":"17712","from_stop_lat":"0.578918189312","from_stop_lon":"29.1183186","to_stop_id":"17710","to_stop_name":"origin","to_stop_lat":"52.132633","placename":"North-Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo","to_stop_lon":"5.291266","to_stop":{"id":"17710","name":"origin","lat":"52.132633","placename":"The Netherlands","lon":"5.291266"},"from_stop":{"name":"origin","id":"17712","lat":"0.578918189312","lon":"29.1183186","placename":"North-Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo"}}],"outgoing":[]}}},"parts":[{"oid":"1042","imid":"8021","linkid":"0","weight":"0","rawemissions":"0","emissions":"0","shipping":"7258.92","processemissions":"0","endoflifeemissions":"0","disposaltype":null,"disposalenergy":null,"disposalimpact":null,"disposalemissions":null,"description":"Cobalt is being used for laptop, cellphone and car batteries.

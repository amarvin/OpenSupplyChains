This also meant a maximum oil reserve ensuring the best possible flavor which made the salmon a valuable commodity.

We produce whole wheat flour from hard winter wheat, buckwheat flour comes from Pennsylvania grown buckwheat, and our corn for grits and meal is locally grown both hybrid yellow and a non-hybrid white corn that is a variety unchanged in the local valley since early settlers brought it in.  The white \"Keener\" corn is a hard, open pollinated flint corn that makes excellent speckled grits and cornmeal.  All our grain products are untreated in any way.  There are no preservatives added and the bran is not sifted away from the germ.   \n\nView Larger Map"},"local_stop_id":5908},{"geometry":"POINT(5976525.942406 3819612.201442)","attributes":{"name":"Maviz Rasins","1":"Iran","address":"Iran","title":"Maviz Rasins","qty":"0","co2e":"0","weight":"0","unit":"kg","description":"seedless sun dried rasin.\n\nView Larger Map"},"local_stop_id":5915}],"hops":[{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((0.000000 0.000000, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"3913","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8062406.883235 5324071.922926, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5794","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8350648.522420 -1027437.355768, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5796","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-13420032.290574 5435181.238622, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5799","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((1777770.909871 4959837.238031, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5800","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-8062406.883235 5324071.922926, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5801","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-7942583.818991 5230178.141232, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5903","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-13229776.827908 6170038.777190, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5904","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-7730634.235848 5661563.301801, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5905","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((-9287421.551752 4156640.243938, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5908","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}},{"geometry":"MULTILINESTRING((5976525.942406 3819612.201442, -7915178.596754 5215775.680007))","from_stop_id":"5915","to_stop_id":"1855","attributes":{"co2e":"0.000000","qty":1,"weight":"0"}}]}}
